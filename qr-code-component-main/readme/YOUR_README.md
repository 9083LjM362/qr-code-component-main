### What I learned
- To connect my 'styles.css' to 'index.tml', replace <style> tag with this <link> tag within the <head> element
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">

- To import Google fonts, write '@import' url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/....)' at top of css file

3. Setting width to 100% means  that the element will take up 100% of the width of its containing element. This allows the element to expand or contract based on the size of its container.
Example: 
.card img {
    width: 100%;
}
